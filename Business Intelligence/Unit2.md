#### **1️⃣ Roll-Up (Aggregation)**
- Moves **from a lower level to a higher level** in the hierarchy.
- Example: **Summarizing sales data from months to quarters to years**.  

📌 *Example Query:*  
- “Show total sales by **year** instead of **months**.”  

#### **2️⃣ Drill-Down (Decomposition)**
- Moves **from a higher level to a lower level** (opposite of Roll-Up).
- Example: **Viewing sales at the month or day level instead of the year**.  

📌 *Example Query:*  
- “Show total sales for **each month** instead of the whole year.”  

#### **3️⃣ Slice**
- Selects **one dimension and fixes a value**, reducing the cube to a **2D view**.  
- Example: Viewing **sales for 2023 only** across product and region.  

📌 *Example Query:*  
- “Show sales for **only 2023**, across all regions and products.”  

#### **4️⃣ Dice**
- Selects **two or more dimensions** to create a **smaller sub-cube**.  
- Example: Viewing **sales for 2023 and 2024 only for Product A & B in North & South regions**.  

📌 *Example Query:*  
- “Show sales for **Products A & B in North & South regions for 2023-2024**.”  



### **Conclusion**  
📌 **OLAP operations help businesses analyze data from different perspectives.**

# Introduction to Decision support systems and Business intelligence


### Q1. Define Business Intelligence. Explain Architecture of BI. [5]

### **Business Intelligence (BI) Definition**  
- Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the technologies, processes, and tools used to collect, integrate, analyze, and present business data.
- The goal of BI is to support decision-making by transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
- It helps organizations identify trends, optimize operations, and improve overall performance.
- It involves the use of data analytics, reporting, and visualization tools to extract insights from large volumes of data.

---

### **Architecture of BI**  
The BI architecture consists of several components that work together to process and analyze data effectively. The key components are:

1. **Data Sources**  
   - Data is collected from various sources such as databases, ERP systems, CRM systems, spreadsheets, and external APIs.
   - Sources can be structured (SQL databases) or unstructured (social media, emails).

2. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**  
   - **Extract:** Data is extracted from different sources.  
   - **Transform:** The extracted data is cleaned, formatted, and integrated into a unified format.  
   - **Load:** The processed data is stored in a data warehouse or a data mart for analysis.

3. **Data Warehouse**  
   - A central repository where processed data is stored for querying and reporting.  
   - It supports historical data storage and allows fast retrieval for analysis.

4. **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) & Data Mining**  
   - OLAP tools allow multidimensional data analysis and fast querying.  
   - Data mining techniques help identify patterns and correlations in large datasets.

5. **Business Intelligence Tools (Visualization & Reporting)**  
   - BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, and QlikView generate reports, dashboards, and interactive visualizations.  
   - These tools help business users make informed decisions.

6. **End-User Access (Decision Support System - DSS)**  
   - The final layer where users interact with the BI system to gain insights.  
   - Decision-makers use reports and dashboards to analyze trends, monitor KPIs, and make strategic decisions.

### Q6. Write a short note on data, information and knowledge with example.[5]

### **Data, Information, and Knowledge**  

In any information system, data, information, and knowledge are essential components for decision-making and analysis. They follow a hierarchy from raw facts to meaningful insights.  

---

### **1. Data** (Raw Facts)  
- Data is **unprocessed** raw facts, figures, or symbols collected from various sources.  
- It has **no meaning** unless processed or analyzed.  
- It is the **foundation** for information and knowledge.

📌 **Example:**  
- "100, 200, 150" (Numbers alone have no meaning).  
- "John, 25, Male" (A set of attributes but no context).  

---

### **2. Information** (Processed Data)  
- Information is **organized and processed data** that provides meaning and context.  
- It is useful for understanding trends, patterns, and relationships.  
- It is the **intermediate step** between data and knowledge.

📌 **Example:**  
- "The sales for January were **100 units, February 200 units, and March 150 units**."  
- "John is **25 years old and male**."  

---

### **3. Knowledge** (Applied Information)  
- Knowledge is **interpreted and analyzed information** used for decision-making.  
- It involves **experience, expertise, and insights** to solve problems or make predictions.
-- It is the **highest level** in the hierarchy. 

📌 **Example:**  
- "Sales are **increasing in February** but dropping in March; a **marketing campaign** may be needed."  
- "John is 25, so he belongs to the **young adult demographic**, which influences his purchasing behavior."  

---

### **Conclusion**  
- **Data** → Raw facts (unprocessed).  
- **Information** → Processed data (meaningful).  
- **Knowledge** → Applied information (decision-making).  

This hierarchy is crucial for **business intelligence, decision-making, and AI systems**. 🚀

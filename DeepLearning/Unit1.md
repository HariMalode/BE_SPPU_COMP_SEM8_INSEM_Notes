### Q6. Write Short Note on: Under and Over fitting regularization. [5]

### **Note on Underfitting, Overfitting, and Regularization**  

#### **1. Underfitting**  
- **Definition:** Occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in data.  
- **Causes:**  
  - Insufficient model complexity (e.g., too few hidden layers or neurons).  
  - Lack of training data or features.  
  - High bias (assumes a strong simplification).  
- **Effects:**  
  - Poor performance on both training and test data.  
  - High error rates and inability to generalize.  

#### **2. Overfitting**  
- **Definition:** Occurs when a model learns the noise and specific details of training data instead of general patterns.  
- **Causes:**  
  - Excessive model complexity (e.g., too many layers or neurons).  
  - Too much training on limited data.  
  - High variance (model is too sensitive to training data).  
- **Effects:**  
  - Excellent performance on training data but poor performance on test data.  
  - Fails to generalize to new, unseen data.  

#### **3. Regularization**  
- **Definition:** Techniques used to prevent overfitting by controlling model complexity.  
- **Common Methods:**  
  - **L1 & L2 Regularization:** Adds a penalty to large weights (L1 = Lasso, L2 = Ridge).  
  - **Dropout:** Randomly ignores neurons during training to prevent reliance on specific features.  
  - **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes activations to stabilize learning.  
  - **Early Stopping:** Stops training when validation accuracy. staits decreasing, preventing model from learning unnecessay details.  

Regularization ensures the model **generalizes well** to unseen data by balancing complexity and accuracy.

### Q7. Write Short note on: Bias, Variance and Tradeoff. [5]

### **Note on Bias, Variance, and Tradeoff**  

#### **1. Bias**  
- **Definition:** Bias refers to the error due to incorrect assumptions in the model.
- **High Bias:**  
  - A model with high bias is too simple & Camat Capture underlying patteins in data.  
  - Example: a a linear regression model trying to predict Complex pattein will have high bias because it assumes relationship is only linear.    
- **Low Bias:**  
  - Model is flexible and can fit the data well.
  
 

#### **2. Variance**  
- **Definition:** Variance refers to model's sensitivity to small changes in training data. Variance measures how much the model’s predictions change with different training datasets.  
- **High Variance:**  
  - A model with high variance learns the training data too well, including noise & random fluctuations, leading to overfitting. 
  - Example: A deep neural network memorizing training data instead of generalizing.  
- **Low Variance:**  
  - Model’s predictions remain stable across different datasets.


#### **3. Bias-Variance Tradeoff**  
- **Definition:** The balance between bias and variance to achieve good model generalization.  
- **Tradeoff Explanation:**  
  - **High Bias, Low Variance → Underfitting** (Model too simple).  
  - **Low Bias, High Variance → Overfitting** (Model too complex).  
  - **Optimal Tradeoff:** A balance where the model generalizes well to unseen data.  

#### **Solution for Good Tradeoff:**  
- **Regularization** (L1/L2, Dropout).  
- **More Training Data** to reduce variance.  
- **Cross-Validation** for model selection.  
- **Feature Selection** to avoid unnecessary complexity.  

A well-balanced model should have **moderate bias and variance**, ensuring good performance on both training and test data.

| **Goal**            | Predicts outcomes based on past examples. | Finds hidden structures and patterns in data. |
| **Algorithms**      | Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks. | Examples: K-Means Clustering, PCA, Autoencoders. |
| **Complexity**      | Easier to interpret but requires labeled data, which can be costly. | More complex and difficult to evaluate as there’s no ground truth. |
